## TEAM_34's Shironeko Bottle Sorting Robot:

Program for the PIC18F4620 microprocessor to control the operations of an autonomous bottle sorting robot.

Written in C with the XC8 compiler.

### Code features include:

Keypad and LCD display for user control of the robot

EEPROM usage to store past operation data

Operation of 3 motors (D.C and Servo) and 5 sensors (Microswitch, Photovoltaic, Color) to differentiate between 10+ randomly loaded bottles of 4 different types and sort each bottle into their respective bin.
